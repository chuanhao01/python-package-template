# Editor specific configs

For editor specific configs that should be tracked, a template should be made and added into the repo here.
The configs that are actively being used and living in the project itself should be added to the project wide `.gitignore`.
It is then up to the other developers whether they would want to use these configs as well.

Notes about the config should be found here or as comments in the respective files.

## .editorconfig

To add:
Copy the file into the root of the project
